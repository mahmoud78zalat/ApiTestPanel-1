# Manual Git Merge Resolution Guide

You're currently stuck in a Git merge state. Here's how to resolve it manually:

## Option 1: Abort the Merge (Safest)

Open the **Shell** tab in Replit and run:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

This will cancel the merge and return you to your previous state.

## Option 2: Complete the Merge

If you want to complete the merge, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Remove the lock file
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

### Step 2: Check for conflicts
```bash
git status
```

### Step 3: If there are conflicted files, edit them
Look for files marked as "both modified" and edit them to remove conflict markers:
- `<<<<<<<` (start of your changes)
- `=======` (separator)
- `>>>>>>>` (end of incoming changes)

### Step 4: Add resolved files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 5: Complete the merge
```bash
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Step 6: Push changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: Force Reset (Nuclear Option)

⚠️ **Warning: This will lose any uncommitted changes**

```bash
git merge --abort
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git push origin main
```

## Quick Resolution Commands

Copy and paste these commands one by one in the Shell:

```bash
# Option A: Abort merge and start fresh
git merge --abort
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop

# Option B: Force sync (loses local changes)
git merge --abort
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

## After Resolution

Once resolved, you can safely use the Replit Git panel again.

Run this to verify everything is clean:
```bash
git status
```

You should see "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
