# Vercel Deployment Fix

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the "raw code display" issue when deploying to Vercel.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Vercel Configuration
**Problem**: The vercel.json was not properly configured to handle both static files and API routes.

**Solution**: Updated vercel.json with proper routing:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "functions": {
    "api/index.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/proxy",
      "destination": "/api/index.js"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. API Handler Improvements
**Problem**: The API handler wasn't properly configured for CORS and error handling in Vercel environment.

**Solution**: Enhanced api/index.js with:
- Proper CORS headers
- OPTIONS request handling
- Better error handling

### 3. Build Process
**Problem**: The build was correctly creating static files, but Vercel wasn't serving them properly.

**Solution**: The build process now correctly:
1. Creates static frontend files in `dist/public/`
2. API serverless function handles `/api/proxy` requests
3. All other routes serve the React SPA

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare your code**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Push your code to your Git repository
   - Import the project in Vercel dashboard
   - Vercel will automatically use the `vercel.json` configuration

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   Set these in your Vercel project settings:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   ```

## Key Changes Made

1. **vercel.json**: Complete rewrite with proper static file serving and API routing
2. **api/index.js**: Added CORS headers and OPTIONS handling
3. **Build Output**: Verified that static files are correctly generated in `dist/public/`

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, verify:
1. **Frontend loads**: Visit your Vercel URL - should show the React app
2. **API works**: Test making API requests through the frontend
3. **Static assets**: Check that CSS and JS files load correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Raw Code Displayed"
- **Cause**: Vercel treating JS files as static content instead of executing them
- **Fix**: Proper vercel.json configuration (now applied)

### "404 on API Routes"
- **Cause**: API routes not properly configured
- **Fix**: Correct rewrites section in vercel.json (now applied)

### "Static Assets Not Loading"
- **Cause**: Incorrect routing for assets
- **Fix**: Filesystem handling in vercel.json routes (now applied)

## Project Structure for Vercel

```
your-app/
├── api/
│   └── index.js          # Serverless API function
├── vercel.json          # Vercel configuration
├── dist/
│   └── public/          # Built frontend files (created by npm run build)
│       ├── assets/      # CSS, JS bundles
│       └── index.html   # Main HTML file
├── client/              # React frontend source
├── server/              # Express backend source (for development)
└── shared/              # Shared types/schemas
```

## Verification Commands

Run these to verify your build before deploying:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Check that files exist
ls -la dist/public/
ls -la dist/public/assets/

# Verify API function exists
ls -la api/
```

Your deployment should now work correctly without showing raw code!
